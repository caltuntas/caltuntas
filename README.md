### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Cihat AltuntaÅŸ and have spent most of my time(15+ years) designing and developing Software Products and Solutions for different industries. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and staying humble because our profession has shown so many times that learning never ends and there is always someone better than me.

I had a chance to use many different programming languages and technologies. After many years, believe it or not,  I'm still curious about anything in Information Technology and trying to learn and experience as much as possible without worrying about either it's a cool tech or not.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as **Technical Manager at Ericsson**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **x86 ASM**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Open Source Projects**
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **Writing Operating Systems**
