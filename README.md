### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Cihat AltuntaÅŸ and have spent most of my time designing and developing Software Products and Solutions for different industries. 
I had a chance to use many different programming languages and technologies and still curious about anything in Information Technology and trying to learn and experience as much as possible without worrying about either it's a cool tech or not.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **x86 ASM**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Open Source Projects**
