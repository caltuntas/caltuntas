### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Cihat AltuntaÅŸ currently working as Technical Manager at Ericsson and have spent most of my time(15+ years) designing and developing Enterprise Software Solutions mostly for the Telecomm industry. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and staying humble because our profession has shown so many times that learning never ends and there is always someone better than me.

Although the platforms in my resume seem to be Java and .NET, I had a chance to use many different programming languages and technologies. After many years, believe it or not,  I'm still curious about anything in computing and try to learn and experience as much as possible without worrying about either it's a cool tech or not.


Here are some ideas to get you started:
